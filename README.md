# Recursion

Use recursion to travel a specified number of nodes and then remove said nodes.

## Getting Started

- Fork repo
- Clone repo into local device
- run "npm i" to install all necessary packages based on your dependencies
- To run your tests run "npm run test" in the test folder from your terminal
- Create a linked list by setting variable as a new LinkedList(), then using the addNode method on it
- addNode(value) inserts a node with a value of "value", call by writing linkedListName.addNode(value)
- call the removeOffset method by writing linkedListName.removeOffset(node, offset), where node is the head of the list you want to call it on, and offset is the number of nodes to traverse before removing them.
